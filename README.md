# _**Analyzing PPP Loan and Census Data Using PySpark : A Comprehensive Exploration**_


## **Project Description**

The aim of this project is to conduct a comprehensive exploration of the PPP loan data and census data using PySpark, a distributed computing framework for big data processing. The study involves analyzing the datasets to identify any correlations, patterns, or trends that may exist between them. The analysis will involve data cleaning, integration, and transformation to provide a comprehensive understanding of the datasets. The project's findings will be useful for policymakers, business owners, and researchers interested in understanding the impact of PPP loans on different demographic groups and local economies.
